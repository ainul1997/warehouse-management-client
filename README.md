My website name: cargoexpress
Description:I made this website by looking at different websites. I tried to make the website better. There was a lack of many tools, I could have done better if I wanted.
My website liveLink:https://warehousecargoexpress.netlify.app/ 

Bullet Points:
1. I have added Header, Neighbor, 6 Production Card, Service, About, footer section on the web site.
2. Headder includes logo, contact number, e-mail, contact or official time.Nevbar has Home, Service, Manage Inventory, ASP, Blog, Contact Us Route.
3. I have added such a design in the production cards. So that if you move the mouse over the card, the details of the products will be shown.
4. If you go to Manage Inventory Route, it will show all the products and you can delete the products if you want. There is also an add button to add new items by clicking.
5. The web site has a login logout function, a social (Google) function. Protected route created.
